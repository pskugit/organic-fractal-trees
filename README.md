# Organic Fractal Trees
> An artistic interpretation of fractal trees written in both javascript and python.

![](/images/trees2.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

Running either script, creates a unique image of a tree. The aim of this work was to make the tree appear as organic as possible whilst still retaining its origin as a fractal tree.
It was inspired by a Coding Challenge by Daniel Schiffman

## JavaScript Version

To run the JavaScript version, simply open trees.html.
The script uses the p5.js JavaScript Processing library.

## Python Version

The python file can be run as is. It is written in Python3 using only the standard libraries.
This project, thus, was also an excercise in translating program code between different languages.
